This project is a recreation of the Mitnick Attack to further understand the relationship between SYN and ACK packets. 
This was a collaboration between myself, Isaac Montano, and Jasmin Gonzalez. 
This project's idea and tasks were provided by SeedLabs and assistance was provided by Dr. Lavanya Mandava from Bradley University. 

Abstract
------------------
The Mitnick attack was created and named after Kevin Mitnick, one of the most well-known hackers in the US and on the FBI’s most wanted list. 
Mitnick successfully launched an attack on Tsutomu Shimomura, a researcher working at the San Diego Supercomputer Center on cellular phone 
network security. Mitnick exploited vulnerabilities in the TCP protocol and trusted relationship between two of Shimomura’s computers with 
the aim of accessing code he needed to hack into the cellular network. Host A was the machine that Mitnick wanted to attack and Host B was 
a trusted server. Mitnick had to impersonate the trusted server so he did not need to provide a password for Host A.
